      <h3>About the Owner, Dr. Pember</h3>
      <p>I am a recent graduate of Long Island University College of Veterinary Medicine. My experience in veterinary medicine focuses on emergency medicine in both specialty and urgent care settings where I am currently employed full time. I am no stranger to patients with poor long-term prognoses and was inspired to help owners find peaceful transitions at home. When I am not on the clock, I spend my free time with my orange feline companion, Roux.</p>
